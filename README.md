# LSTM-Word-Prediction
This project uses LSTM, a type of neural network, for next word prediction. You input a seed text and specify the desired length. The LSTM model then generates the next word based on learned patterns from training data. It's a user-friendly tool for exploring how well the model can predict and generate coherent text continuations.
